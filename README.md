The project is intended to provide snapshot and state sync via RPC’s services for cosmos blockchains. It relies on dedicated server infrastructure.

Snapshots are taken every day and zipped to minimize the size as much as possible. From time to time we are going to state sync snapshot machines when the size reaches 50-100GB.

State sync is done with 2000 block interval so in worse case scenario you’ll need to catch up 2000 blocks which takes you only a few minutes.

We are glad to become a part of the blockchain community, let’s make the blockchain world a better place together.
